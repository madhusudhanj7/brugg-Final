Our History
One Man. One Vision. Going Up.

Brugg Lifting is a leading global organisation in the production of elevator ropes. Our history goes back over a hundred years and to our Founder Gottlieb Suhner. In May 1896, the foundation of our company was laid when Gottlieb Suhner opened a cable factory in Brugg, Switzerland.

In 1910, Brugg became the first company in Switzerland to manufacture ropes for mountain cable cars. Kabelwerke Brugg entered the global market as early as 1985 with the establishment of a branch in Houston. The segment of wire ropes manufactured was extended in the same year with the acquisition of Schweizerische Seilindustrie AG based in Shaffhausen.
