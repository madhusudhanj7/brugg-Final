Elevator ropes from Brugg Lifting. Tips for rope handling.

    This section provides important information and tips regarding the properties of ropes and the handling of ropes. If required, we will provide you with additional information and will of course be available to us to answer any questions.

All elevator ropes of Brugg Wire Rope Inc. are lubricated during the production process. Since it is not under our influence, how long the ropes are stored until the mounting, we recommend checking the elevator ropes directly after their installation for sufficient lubrication and, if needed, lubricating again. The further lubrication of the ropes should be effected as required. The ropes must however never be used in an unlubricated state. A sufficient amount of lubricant has to be on the rope, it must not drip however from the rope during the ride of the lift. We recommend the use of the special regreasing agent of Brugg or an equal lubricant. If you relubricate in time, you can increase the service life of the rope.

When is lubrication needed? If there are no traces of lubricant left on your fingers when you touch the rope, you need to relubricate. How much lubrication is needed? 0,4 litres of lubricant per centimetre wire rope diameter and 100 metres rope (relating to Brugg relubricant). Principles for relubrication You should relubricate your wire ropes often, but sparingly. The lubricant has to be evenly distributed on the complete rope surface. The relubrication should be only done on clean rope humidity, dust, etc. Demands on the relubricant The relubricant has to be mixable with the mineral original lubricant. It has be able to penetrate well, the coefficient of friction µ 0 09 material pair steel cast iron has to be reached, so that the degree of traction is preserved.
